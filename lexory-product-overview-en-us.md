# Lexory — Product overview (EN-US)

## What is Lexory
**Lexory** is a **PDF + text reader** designed for language learning while you read. Instead of translating an entire document, you translate **only what you need**, instantly, with **click/selection translation** and **saved vocabulary**.

The goal is to keep you in the reading flow: fewer context switches, more reading, and vocabulary that comes from real content.

## Who it’s for
- **Language learners** who want to practice with real materials (PDFs, notes, articles).
- **People reading docs** in another language who need quick, in-context translation.
- **Anyone building vocabulary** from what they actually read day-to-day.

## How it works (3 steps)
1. **Open a PDF or TXT**
   - Upload a local file or open documents from your library (if logged in).
2. **Translate in context**
   - **Click** a word to translate it.
   - **Select** a phrase to translate a snippet.
3. **Save and review vocabulary**
   - Translations can be saved to build a study list.

## Key features
- **PDF and TXT reader**
  - Page navigation (including paginated TXT).
  - Reading controls (e.g., zoom/adjustments where applicable).

- **Instant click-to-translate**
  - Click a word and see the translation without leaving the page.

- **Selection translation (phrases/snippets)**
  - Select a phrase and translate it.
  - Selection can be expanded to **full-word boundaries**.

- **Saved vocabulary**
  - Lexory can store translation pairs (original → translated) for later review.

- **Account + library (when logged in)**
  - Store documents in your library.
  - Re-open documents easily and keep reading progress.

## What Lexory is NOT (honest expectations)
- It’s not a “perfect PDF translator” that preserves every layout.
- Scanned/image-only PDFs can be limited (when there’s no selectable text).
- Machine translation quality varies by language and context.

## Privacy and data
- Lexory doesn’t need to upload your whole document to translate a word or phrase.
- Only the **selected text** is sent to the translation endpoint.
- If you use an account/library, some metadata may be stored to enable features (e.g., re-opening documents, reading progress, saved translations).

## Quick use-cases
- Reading an English **paper** and translating only technical terms.
- Studying from a **handout** while building vocab as you go.
- Reading a **document** in another language with lightweight in-context translation.

## Tips
- Use **click** for single words.
- Use **selection** for phrases.
- Save the translations you want to review later.

If you want, I can also:
- Rewrite this as **landing-page copy** (more persuasive, with CTAs).
- Create a shorter “1-minute overview” for in-app onboarding.
